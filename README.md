I am a Computer Science student at The University Of Huddersfield, developing passion projects here on GitHub and am focused on learning CS Fundamentals to apply to my work. I mainly program in C++ but am also looking at other technologies such as Java, Javascript, and React among others. Feel free to reach out to me via my Linkedin Page and check out my Project Demos on YouTube.
